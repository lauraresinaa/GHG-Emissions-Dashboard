# 🌍 GHG Emissions Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Project Description & Methodology

This project presents an interactive dashboard built with **R Shiny**, designed to explore and analyze **global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions** data. The dashboard provides a user-friendly platform structured across three main tabs:

- **GHG Evolution**: Trends over time for selected countries or regions  
- **GHG per Capita**: Emissions per person by income group  
- **GHG Contribution**: Countries' and continents' share of total global emissions  

Users can filter data by **year**, **country**, and **emission type**, enabling tailored analysis and deeper insights into global emission dynamics.

## 📊 Data Sources

- [EDGAR (Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research) – European Commission](https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/report_2024?vis=ghgpop#data_download)  
- [World Bank – Historical income classification](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups)  
- [Our World in Data – Regional definitions](https://ourworldindata.org/world-region-map-definitions)

**Note**: Emissions from *International Aviation* and *International Shipping* were excluded due to their relatively small share (0.719% and 0.034%, respectively) of total global emissions.

## 📈 Dashboard Visualizations

1. **GHG Evolution** – Tracks the growth of GHG emissions in the **Euro Area**, **EU27**, and **worldwide**  
2. **GHG per Capita** – Compares emissions per person, aggregated by **World Bank income groups**  
3. **GHG Contribution** – Visualizes the **share of GHG emissions** by country and continent relative to the global total

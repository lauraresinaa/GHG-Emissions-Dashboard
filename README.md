PROJECT DESCRIPTION & METHODOLOGY:
This GHG emissions analysis was conducted through an interactive dashboard developed using R Shiny. The dashboard offers a comprehensive platform for visualizing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data, structured into three distinct tabs: GHG Evolution, GHG per Capita, and GHG Contribution. Users can engage with the data through dynamic filtering options, enabling tailored analyses by year, country, and data type, thereby providing an insightful user experience.
 
 Data Sources:
• Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) report on the global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions around the world (European Commission): https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/report_2024?vis=ghgpop#data_download)
• Historical classification by income (World Bank): https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups
• World regions according to Our World in Data: https://ourworldindata.org/world-region-map-definitions

 Data Manipulation:
International Aviation and International Shipping were excluded from this analysis, as they account for less than 1% of global total emissions, specifically 0.719% and 0.034%, respectively.


Using data from the above website – specifically, the data contained in the EDGAR GHG emissions files – I prepared three charts:
- Chart 1 – Evolution of GHG growth in the euro area, European Union (EU27) and worldwide;
- Chart 2 – Comparison of countries’ GHG emissions per capita aggregated according to the World Bank income groups;
- Chart 3 – Contribution of individual country and continent GHG emissions to total world GHG emissions.
